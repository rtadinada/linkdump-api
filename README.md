# LinkDump API Tutorial

This GitHub repository is intended as a companion to
[my API server guide](https://www.ravitadinada.com/blog/tech/linkdump-api-guide).
In it, I go through implementing the API specification in the `api.yaml` file.
Follow along here with the guide to check your code against mine (or to just
steal if you're lazy like me).

This commit contains the implementation up to:
[Part 1](https://www.ravitadinada.com/blog/tech/linkdump-api-guide-pt1) Section 2.2 - Adding Express
